## About get_next_line

The objective of this project is handling static variables in C and correctly managing memory leaks after repeated calls to the function being developed. The function to be developed should return the next line from one or more files referenced by a file descriptor, after repeated calls, for different files, without returning the same line more than once.

### 🔹 Function prototype:
char	*get_next_line(int fd)
